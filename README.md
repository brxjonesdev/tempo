### Tempo

I wanted a minimalist, focused tool for timeboxing that didn’t come with the distractions or complexity of traditional productivity apps. Tempo is designed to support intentional work through a simple ritual: set a block of time, stay present, and reflect afterward. Everything is stored locally, no syncing, just your focus and progress.

#### Features

* Create custom or preset timeblocks (e.g. Pomodoro, sprints)
* Reflect with a short post-session journal
* View your focus sessions on a clean daily timeline
* Fully offline functionality using local storage
* Minimal, responsive UI with dark mode support

#### Tech Stack

* **Next.js** – React-based framework 
* **React** – UI library for building the frontend
* **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS for fast and flexible styling
* **Dexie.js** – A wrapper around IndexedDB for managing local data


## Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brxjonesdev/tempo.git
cd tempo
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
